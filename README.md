# VS Code Settings

Sometimes VS Code settings sync <del>doesn't work</del> works. Often I open VS Code on a different machine and it's using settings from 6 months ago.

So I decided to store my own settings.

Some of settings I've changed the things I've changed include:
  * using One Dark Pro Flat theme
  * hiding almost every bit of UI that can be hidden including tabs and navigation buttons
  * moving the terminal to the right side of the window, and file explorer to the right
  * custom keyboard shortcuts including:
    * ``ctrl + ` `` to toggle the terminal
    * `ctrl + alt + N` to toggle line numbers
    * `ctrl + alt + v` to toggle vertical lines
    * `ctrl + alt + E` to wrap selection with a new HTML tag
    * `ctrl + alt + A` to wrap selection with a new HTML tag
    * `ctrl + shift + E` to show file explorer

## To Export
  * `File > Preferences > Profiles > Export Profile...`

## To Import
  * `File > Preferences > Profiles > Import Profile...`
